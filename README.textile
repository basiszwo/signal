2.  Copy config/deploy.rb.sample to config/deploy.rb

2.1 Configure config/deploy.rb

2.2 Setup the application in the remote host:

<pre><code>rake inploy:remote:setup</code></pre>

Or if you are installing the application in the local machine:

2. Setup the application

<pre><code>rake inploy:local:setup</code></pre>

3. Configure config/mailer.yml

4. Start a job:

<pre><code>RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job start</code></pre>

h2. PROJECTS

Every project you are importing needs to have a rake build task.
